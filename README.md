Project 7_Implementation of a loan scoring model


Dashboard - Streamlit 
The dashboard is built to assess the eligibility of all loan applicants. It is divided into three options – prediction, comparison, and interpretation. First, the identity number of the applicant is required to access some personal details in the sidebar that returns some of personal information of the clients, result, and the decision. The score is displayed inform of a gauge that shows the applicants score and how risky he or she is to be a defaulter or not. Scores within the green part of the gauge suggest a good client, those close to the decision threshold boundary (42.5%) may like default or not, while scores above 50 have high potential to default and fall in the red region. The threshold limit is represented by the thick red bar at the 42.5 optimal threshold. 

The comparison option produces plots of how the applicant’s rank amongst others based on selected features and the score. The interpretation page gives a graphic information of the individual and global important features that in the prediction process.
